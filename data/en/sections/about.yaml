# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a Data Scientist with an academic background. I hold a degree in Physics, an MSc, and a PhD in Astronomy, and I am a self-taught software developer. I love coding! Currently, I lead a small team of developers who are experts in software to support e-science. We build online platforms to help Astronomers do big data analysis. Fun fact: I started learning piano during the pandemic.'
